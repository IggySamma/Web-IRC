My plan is to try build an irc chat like from back in the day.

This is a learning project for me to learn GO

My goals:

Make Web socket connection from scratch for channel to end users

Channel creators have elevated permissions to include:
Kick
Ban (by ip and Mac address)
Silence for time period
Shadow ban (ban without notification and chats blank always to end user banned)
Give other users customised privileges

Chats to be stored in memory so no history of chats

Possibly whisper functionality
